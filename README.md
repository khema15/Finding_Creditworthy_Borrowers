By analyzing historical financial data and behavioral patterns, the system identifies borrowers who are likely to repay loans reliably, helping financial institutions reduce defaults and optimize lending decisions.


💡 Objectives

Predict whether a loan applicant is creditworthy or not.

Improve accuracy over traditional credit scoring methods.

Help financial institutions make informed, data-backed lending decisions.
